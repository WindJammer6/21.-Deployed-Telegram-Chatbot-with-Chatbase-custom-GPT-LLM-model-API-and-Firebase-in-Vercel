What is the difference between Reply Keyboard buttons and Inline Keyboard buttons in a Telegram Bot?
In the '910. telegram's_KeyboardButton_class_and_ReplyKeyboardMarkup_class.py' file and '911. telegram's_
InlineKeyboardButton_class_and_InlineKeyboardMarkup_class_and_mapping_the_self-made_Python_functions_to_
CallbackQueryHandler.py' file, we have implemented Reply Keyboard buttons and Inline Keyboard buttons 
respectively in a Telegram Bot. But what is the difference between there two features?

Both Reply Keyboard buttons and Inline Keyboard buttons are used to provide users with a set of 
predefined buttons, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:
1. Reply Keyboard
    - Appearance: The Reply Keyboard appears as a custom keyboard attached to the text input field. 
                It looks similar to the default on-screen keyboard but with custom buttons.
    
    - Behavior: When a user taps a button on the Reply Keyboard, the button's label is sent as a 
                regular reply message from the user to the Telegram Bot. The Reply Keyboard remains 
                visible until it is manually removed by the Telegram Bot or replaced by a new keyboard.
    
    - Use Cases: It's useful when you want to suggest input options to users, such as answering 
                questions with "Yes," "No," or "Maybe."

2. Inline Keyboard
    - Appearance: The Inline Keyboard appears directly inside the message bubble, with buttons positioned 
                below the message text.

    - Behavior: When a user taps a button on the Inline Keyboard, it does not send a message from the user. 
                Instead, it triggers a callback query that is sent to the Telegram Bot, which can handle it without 
                cluttering the chat with messages. Inline Keyboard buttons can be configured to trigger URLs, 
                switch to inline mode, or send callback data to the Telegram Bot.

    - Use Cases: Ideal for creating interactive interfaces within a single message, such as navigating 
                through options, triggering actions, or opening links.
