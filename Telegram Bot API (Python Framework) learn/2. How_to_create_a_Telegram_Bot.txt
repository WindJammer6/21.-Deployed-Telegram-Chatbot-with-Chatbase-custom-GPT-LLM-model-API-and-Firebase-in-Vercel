How to create a Telegram Bot?
You create a Telegram Bot not directly from the Telegram Bot API (Python Framework) in code in your IDE. 
Rather, you create a Telegram Bot on the Telegram messaging platform on your device seperately. Here's how to 
do it:

    1. Go to the Telegram messaging platform.
    
    2. On the search chats/channels bar, search and click on 'BotFather' (be careful to select the verified
       'BotFather' Telegram Bot with the blue tick)
       (Note: 'BotFather' is itself a Telegram Bot that Telegram has created to automate the creation of 
              all other Telegram Bots by developers)

    3. In the conversation with 'BotFather' here are the series of commands you need to provide to create
       a. Enter the command '/newbot'. 
          - You should get the reply from 'BotFather': 'Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please 
            choose a name for your bot.'
       
       b. Enter the desired name for the Telegram Bot, e.g. 'test'. 
          - You should get the reply from 'BotFather': 'Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must 
            end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.'

       c. Choose a unique username for the Telegram Bot, and it should end with 'Bot' or '_bot', 
          e.g. 'test_12171_bot'.
          - If the name is already taken, you will get the reply from 'BotFather': 'Sorry, this username is 
            already taken. Please try something different.' 
          - Otherwise if name is not already taken, you will get the reply from 'BotFather': 
            'Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/sample1217_bot. You can now add a 
            description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By 
            the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better 
            username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

            Use this token to access the HTTP API:
            **********************************************
            
            Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

            For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api'

       d. Enter the command '/setprivacy'. We will want to set the privacy status of the Telegram Bot to 
          private so no one can misuse your Telegram Bot token and keep your Telegram Bot secure.
          - You should get the reply from 'BotFather': 'Choose a bot to change group messages settings.'

       e. A dashboard will appear showing all of your Telegram Bots. Select the recently created Telegram 
          Bot (e.g. 'test_12171_bot')
          - You should get the reply from 'BotFather': 
            ''Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start with the '/' symbol or mention 
            the bot by username.
            
            'Disable' - your bot will receive all messages that people send to groups.
            
            Current status is: ENABLED.'

       f. Another dashboard will appear showing the 'Enable' and 'Disable' options. Select 'Disable' to make
          your Telegram Bot's privacy to private.
          - You should get the reply from 'BotFather': 'Success! The new status is: DISABLED. /help'


(Note: Take note of the HTTP API token/key of the Telegram Bot! You will need it in order to access that 
       particular Telegram Bot in the Telegram Bot API (Python Framework) in code in your IDE!!!)
